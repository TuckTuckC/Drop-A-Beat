# Drop a Beat

## Concept: 
A patform for Beatboxers, similar to instagram. Beatboxers can post comment, and add favorite beatboxers to their profile.

## Wireframes:

## Technologies Used:
    - EJS
    - CSS 
    - NodeJS 
    - JavaScript
    - Express
    - MongoDB

## User Stories
    - As a user, I want to be able to create an account
    - As a user, I want to be able to log into my account
    - As a user, I want to ba able to add my favorite beatboxers to my profile
    - As a user, I want to be able to post
    - As a user, I want to be able to see other user's posts
    - As a user, I want to be able to comment on a posts
    - As a user, I want to be able to view other profiles
    - As a user, I want to be able to delete a post

## Approach: 
First I am going to set up the server and mongoDB. Then I am going to create the log in page and start with Oauth so that when I am calling my variables later in the code, I am using the correct ones for the user and I won't have to go back later and redo the variables. AFter that I am going to start working on the routes for the webpage to make sure everything goes where I want it to go. At that point I am going to create the functionality for posts first, and then work on comments.
